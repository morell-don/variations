            <h3><div class="bl"> <strong><big>S</big></strong>ome say the world will end in <strong>Fire</strong>,</h3><br> 
            Some say in <strong>Ice</strong>.<br>
            From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire<br>
            I hold with those who favor <strong>Fire</strong>.<br>
            But if it had to perish twice,<br>
            I think I know enough of hate<br>
            To say that for destruction <strong>Ice</strong><br>
            Is also great<br>
            And would suffice.<br>
