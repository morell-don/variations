            Some say the world will end in Fire, <br>

            Some say in Ice. <br>

            From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire <br>

            I hold with those who favor Fire. <br>

            But if it had to perish twice, <br>

            I think I know enough of hate <br>

            To say that for destruction Ice <br>

            Is also great <br>

            And would suffice. <br>
