            Some say the world will end in Fire, <br>
            Some say in Ice. <br>

            From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire <br>
            I hold with those who favor Fire. <br>
            


            
            But if it had to perish twice, <br>
            I think I know enough of hate <br>
            
           
            
            To say that for destruction Ice <br>
            Is also great <br>
            </div>

            <div class = "bl3">
            And would suffice. 
            </div>
